## Travel Advisor

This is the repo for a Travel Advisor app that I create while learning the google maps API. It displays places close by based on geo location.

## Install

cd into the root of the repository and run the following commands:

`
npm install
`

Create a .env file in the root of the directory with the following values:

`
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_TRAVEL_API_KEY=
`

## Run

Run the following command:

`
npm start
`
